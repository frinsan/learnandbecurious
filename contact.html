  <h3>Reach out</h3>
  <p>
    You can reach me at
    <a class="card-link" href="mailto:g@learnandbecurious.com">g@learnandbecurious.com</a>.
    If you’re building something, include a short description of what you’re working on and any relevant links or context.

<section class="detail-section">
  <h3>What to expect</h3>
  <p>
    I try to respond within a few days. Initial conversations are usually lightweight and exploratory, with the goal of understanding whether there’s a good fit to continue the discussion. Over time, some collaborations may evolve into more structured or paid engagements.

  <h3>Stay in the loop</h3>
  <p>
    This site is updated as new apps ship and platforms evolve. If you’re curious about the work or want to follow along, bookmarking the site is the best way to stay up to date for now.

<section class="detail-section">
  <h3>Work together</h3>
  <p>
    I’m open to collaborating with engineers, designers, or builders who are actively working on real projects and want to build alongside me. This isn’t a formal program or open call—just an invitation to connect if our interests overlap and it feels mutually useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    If that sounds interesting, send a short note describing what you’re building or what you’d like to work on together.
