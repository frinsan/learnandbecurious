      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Learn and Be Curious is a “platform app factory” designed to make it easy to build, brand, and ship many iOS apps without starting from scratch each time. Instead of creating a new codebase per app, the system centralizes everything that should be shared (auth, networking, backend services, CI/CD patterns, observability, security defaults) and pushes everything that should vary per app into a small brand repo (manifest + assets + optional overlay code).</p>
      <p>At a high level, the platform has three moving parts:</p>
      <ol class="detail-list">
        <li><strong>Platform backend (platform-backend/):</strong> a multi-tenant AWS serverless backend with staging and prod environments, Cognito auth (Apple/Google Hosted UI + optional native email), a versioned API (/v1/...), and DynamoDB persistence keyed by appId.</li>
        <li><strong>iOS template app (ios-app-template/):</strong> a working SwiftUI starter app with a sidebar shell, manifest-driven configuration, auth/session handling, and a typed API client.</li>
        <li><strong>Brand repos (e.g., app-sample/):</strong> a lightweight repository per app that supplies app.json (bundle id, display name, theme, API/auth config, feature flags, legal links, versions) plus assets and optional Overlay/TemplateApp/... Swift overrides.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The “factory” mechanism turns a brand repo into a buildable iOS project by creating a scratch copy of the template and applying the brand’s manifest + overlay automatically (bundle ID, Info.plist, URL scheme, app icon/assets, versions). This keeps the template repo clean and makes iteration fast while supporting CI workflows that can produce signed archives for TestFlight/App Store distribution.</p>

      <h3>Built with</h3>
      <ul class="detail-list">
        <li><strong>Idea:</strong> The goal was to standardize and accelerate shipping many small, branded apps by making “new app creation” mostly configuration and assets rather than new code.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> OpenAI ChatGPT and Codex were used as iterative collaborators to explore architecture options, define onboarding workflows, and implement end-to-end scaffolding quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Graphic Design:</strong> No dedicated design toolchain. Branding is driven by per-app assets (icons/splash/colors) and a manifest-controlled theme (primary/accent/appearance).</li>
        <li><strong>UI System:</strong> Template-first: a consistent sidebar shell and a neutral baseline that can be overridden per brand via overlays.</li>
        <li><strong>Architecture Design:</strong> Split architecture: one shared backend, one shared iOS template, many per-brand repos. Multi-tenant backend with data partitioning and authorization keyed by appId.</li>
        <li><strong>Environments:</strong> Two environments (staging/prod) to support QA/TestFlight builds before production promotion.</li>
        <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Automation-first scripts and reusable workflows compose the final branded app at build time rather than forking the template codebase per brand.</li>
        <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Ship a working baseline app (sidebar shell + login + blank home), manifest-driven configuration, Cognito Hosted UI auth, and a repeatable new-brand launch process.</li>
        <li><strong>Development:</strong> Monorepo workspace for backend, iOS template, and example brand repos. build_brand.sh creates scratch copies; apply_manifest.sh validates JSON and rewrites bundle IDs, Info.plist display name, URL schemes, versions, and assets.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Template includes TemplateAppTests and can be exercised via xcodebuild test; primary validation is end-to-end smoke testing in staging before production.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Backend deploys via AWS CDK with separate staging/prod stacks; iOS builds produced locally or in GitHub Actions workflows for TestFlight/App Store distribution.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>AI inside</h3>
      <p>The iOS template includes a feature-flagged “AI Playground” screen used to validate AI plumbing. When available, it uses Apple’s on-device Foundation Models integration (SystemLanguageModel via FoundationModels) to rewrite text (clearer/more formal/shorter). When unavailable (simulators or unsupported devices), it falls back to deterministic local transforms so the UI remains testable and predictable.</p>
