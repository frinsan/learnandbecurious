  <h3>Why this space exists</h3>
  <p>
    learn &amp; be curious exists to make the process of building software with AI more concrete and practical. Rather than focusing on abstract ideas or throwaway prototypes, this space documents real apps built end to end—how ideas turn into working products, and how AI tools fit into that process.

  <h3>Principles</h3>
  <p>
    I build in public and iterate as I go. That means shipping real software, reusing shared platforms where it makes sense, and refining workflows based on what actually works in practice—not just what sounds good in theory. AI is used as a tool throughout the workflow, while decisions and tradeoffs remain intentional and human-driven.

<section class="detail-section">
  <h3>What you can expect</h3>
  <p>
    You’ll find concise case studies of shipped apps, notes on tooling and workflows, and write-ups on architectural decisions, automation, and lessons learned as the projects evolve. If you’re interested in how AI fits into real product development—not just demos—this site is meant to be practical and transparent.
