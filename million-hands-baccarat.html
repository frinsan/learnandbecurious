      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Million Hands is a data-driven baccarat assistant built to explore how large-scale simulation data can be combined with modern LLMs. The app is backed by a database of over one million simulated baccarat hands, allowing users to ask questions about outcomes, streaks, side bets, and probabilities and receive answers grounded in empirical results.</p>
      <p>The focus of the project is instructional and exploratory: demonstrating how AI agents, structured data, and real-time querying can be combined into a production-ready application across mobile platforms.</p>

      <h3>Built with</h3>
      <ul class="detail-list">
        <li><strong>Graphic Design:</strong> No dedicated graphic design process or tools used; UI and visual layout generated through prompts to ChatGPT and Codex, then refined directly in code.</li>
        <li><strong>Architecture Design:</strong> System architecture designed collaboratively using OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-4), focusing on empirical data pipelines, agent-based reasoning, and real-time query handling with emphasis on correctness, traceability, and data grounding.</li>
        <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Developed incrementally with assistance from OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-4). Scope refined through iteration and live usage rather than fixed upfront specifications; primary requirement was prioritizing empirical analysis over theoretical responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Development:</strong> Phase 1 assisted by OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-4) with manual copy-paste of code, local compilation, and execution. Phase 2 transitioned to OpenAI Codex Web (GPT-4) using a Git-based workflow for improved iteration and structure. All code reviewed, compiled, and run manually.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> No automated test suite. Validation performed through manual testing, data inspection, and live app usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Backend and infrastructure deployed manually. No CI/CD pipeline or automated release process; ongoing updates handled through hands-on deployment and monitoring.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>AI inside</h3>
      <p>Million Hands: Baccarat Chat AI uses OpenAI GPT-4 for chat, including a tool-using LangChain agent that can answer empirical questions by querying the baccarat database (SQL tools) and a separate GPT-4 theory mode for rules and probability explanations. In parallel, the app serves a custom next-hand prediction model trained on 1,000,000+ baccarat hands. That training corpus is generated at the shoe level: a full shoe is shuffled using a seeded randomizer (recorded as a per-shoe <strong>shuffle_seed</strong>, with burn-card handling), then hands are dealt using standard baccarat drawing rules. Histories reset at each new shoe so sequences do not leak across shoes. The model (a scikit-learn RandomForest) learns from these realistic per-shoe histories using hashed sequence n-gram features and returns next-outcome probabilities.</p>
