  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Visa Photo is a lightweight iOS app for creating passport and visa photos in common consulate-friendly sizes. It was the first fully branded app built on top of my shared iOS template and backend, used to validate the end-to-end app factory workflow (manifest + overlay + automated builds).
  </p>
  <p>
    The core user flow is intentionally minimal: capture or upload a photo, choose a preset (visa/passport) or enter a custom size, align the face using a cropping guide with zoom/drag controls, and export the final image at the target dimensions.

  <h3>Built with</h3>
  <ul class="detail-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Idea:</strong>
      I talked through the concept and scope with ChatGPT, focusing on a minimal, offline-first photo utility and avoiding upsell-heavy flows common in similar apps.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Graphic Design:</strong>
      I used ChatGPT to keep branding intentionally minimal and consistent with the shared template’s theming system (manifest-driven colors and a small set of assets).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Architecture Design:</strong>
      Inherited directly from the shared App Platform. The app is implemented as a brand overlay on top of the existing SwiftUI template, reusing the platform’s navigation shell, configuration model, and backend integration without redesigning architecture.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Requirements:</strong>
      I used ChatGPT to define a tight requirements set: a small preset library (mm + DPI), a custom size option, an alignment guide with zoom/drag controls, deterministic exports, and an offline-friendly experience.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Development:</strong>
      I used the VS Code + OpenAI Codex extension (GPT-5) to implement the full photo workflow end to end, including the step-based UI, crop/zoom/drag behavior, export pipeline, and integration as a brand repo (manifest + overlay).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Testing:</strong>
      I used the VS Code + OpenAI Codex extension (GPT-5) to iteratively run the app, validate edge cases, and fix issues discovered during end-to-end flow testing (capture/import → crop → export → save).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Deployment:</strong>
      Deployment is provided by the shared App Platform. The app is built by applying its manifest and overlay to the template and running the platform’s reusable CI workflow to produce a signed artifact for TestFlight or App Store submission.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>AI inside</h3>
  <p>None. The app is intentionally non-AI and focused on deterministic photo sizing and cropping.</p>

  <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
  <ul class="detail-list">
    <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Swift, SwiftUI</li>
